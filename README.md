# CGAIK (This page is actively being edited)

Closed-form geometric inverse kinematics (IK) solver based on conformal geometric algebra (CGA), a powerful mathematical framework for representing geometry. 

CGA, in a simple and elegant way, provides numerous geometric insights into the robot that are difficult or nearly impossible to achieve using traditional matrix methods. 

The IK solver have been implemented in ROS 2 C++ and tested on two robots:
- 6-DoF collaborative robotic arm (TM5-700 and TM5-900)
- 3-DoF spherical parallel manipulator (SPM)
